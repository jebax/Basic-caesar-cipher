Basic Caesar Cipher

This is a basic caesar cipher exercise. Only letters [A-Za-z] are affected by the cipher. 
I added a decrypt function, but it requires that the user knows the value of the shift to perform the decryption.

To install: load in IRB
Example input: example = CaesarCipher.new("Hello World!", 8)
